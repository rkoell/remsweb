          <h3>Thinkpad T460</h3>
          <p>This is a computer I got relatively recently off ebay. I put Arch Linux on it, partly to get
            experience with how Linux works and partly to avoid proprietary spyware NSA slop. I use it for most
            things at this point, except schoolwork and most gaming. It's too weak to run a bunch of stuff at
            the same time (Spotify, Discord, Firefox) but that's really because Spotify and Discord are insanely
            bloated. I started using a spotify client that runs in the terminal (spotify-player with spotifyd) and it works pretty
             well, but usually I use mpv with music stored locally or on my Jellyfin server.
          </p>
          <p>I'm currently trying out Hyprland, and it works really nicely. I noticed that loading chunks in Minecraft is a far more pleasant experience when I'm using Hyprland rather than Plasma, and the experience of using a tiling window manager is pleasant as well. I had fun configuring everything. My plasma desktop is still shown in the image on the left though.
          </p>
          <p>This website was written on this computer using VSCodium. I do have Neovim set up with NVChad,
             which is really nice, but I'm too dependent on the live server extension to really use it extensively
             (at least for web design.)

          <h3>Legion 5</h3>
          <p>This is a laptop I got when I started college. I used it for everything at the time, but now
             use it for gaming and schoolwork mostly. I really don't play games that much anymore, and when I
             do it's usually Minecraft, which is non-demanding enough to play comfortably on the Thinkpad. The
             main reason I still use it anymore is for Visual Studio, since my data structures class requires it. I
             also run a Minecraft server on it, which I planned to move to the Debian server, but the hardware on
             that unsurprisingly turned out to be too weak to handle it.
          </p>
          <p>When Windows 10 stops being supported, I'll probably move this computer over to Linux too. I'll
             probably go with Arch again depending on how unstable my Thinkpad installation ends up being over time.

          <h3>Latitude E6520</h3>
          <p>This is the laptop I'm using as a server right now. I put a 1 TB HDD in it and installed Debian 12.
             It currently just runs this website using nginx and my Jellyfin server, both in Docker containers.
             I plan to eventually set up an email server, but I've heard that's a massive pain so I don't know
             when I'll get around to that.
